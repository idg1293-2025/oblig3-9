We started with the idea of a bird traveling around the world showing disasters from a bird perspective. After a brainstorming-session we narrowed it down to a more manageable idea of taking the user through a small journey to make them aware of the impact deforrestation has on wildlife. We then listed some scenes and roughly how the journey should look like. The story we have created is a story of how humans deforestations impacts both nature and the existing wildlife, mainly in Norway, but it applies around the world.  
 
Together we have mainly worked on different sections of the story. In the end we merged and helped each other in the different parts and tried to make it all work well together. We have tried to make it clear in the code and branches what we have been working on, implemented scripts that take care of the journeys path and some functions. We also have eventListeners that reacts on the users scrolling and clicks.  
 
Project Presentation "Goal 15: Life on Land" 1. Introduction: Choosing the Topic We chose Goal 15: Life on Land from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The purpose of the project is to highlight the issue of environmental destruction: deforestation, species extinction, and land degradation. We wanted the user to feel the scale of nature loss through a visual storytelling experience. 2. Project Idea The main theme is deforestation and the gradual disappearance of nature due to human activities. We decided to use scroll-telling – a story that unfolds as the user scrolls through the page. At first, the user sees vibrant nature, then human intervention and finally the loss of natural resources and climate change. 3. Project Architecture and Technologies The project is structured according to the BEM methodology for clean and readable code. Styles are written using SCSS and variables to simplify and unify the workflow. Technologies and techniques used in the project: SVG graphics for lightweight loading and high-quality visualization; CSS animations, including: shrinkIce — shrinking the ice platform; sinkBear — sinking polar bears; fall — falling snow effect; slide-left — moving football fields to symbolize the loss of land; expand-brown — changing the shape of the hills. /// Der trenger litt mer text 4. Workflow We started with a brainstorming session: Discussed key issues affecting Goal 15. Identified the main focus points: deforestation and habitat loss. Agreed on the project structure: Beginning — vibrant forests; Middle — active deforestation and landscape changes, with a clear example of the scale of the problem; Ending — melting ice and disappearance of life traces. 5. Implementation Features The project uses smooth scrolling and a minimalist presentation, making the website intuitive and emotionally engaging. A final slide with a call to action encourages users to think about environmental protection. We added a flying bee as a symbol of biodiversity and a reminder of the importance of preserving all life on land. 6. Challenges and Difficulties One of the main challenges was to integrate different code parts developed by various team members into a cohesive, unified website. We had to carefully coordinate styles, class structures, and element behaviors during scrolling to maintain consistency and smooth storytelling. // Der også trenger vi mer text 7. Conclusion and Reflection The project allowed us to combine technical coding skills with a creative approach to visual storytelling. We gained a deeper understanding of how visual elements enhance the emotional impact of complex topics. As a result, the project fully meets the technical and conceptual requirements of the assignment: SCSS, BEM, CSS animations, and GitHub collaboration.
